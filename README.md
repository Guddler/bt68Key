Bluetooth version of the Sharp X68000 USB keyboard adapter.

**NB 1:** This is a very ealy WIP version right now and contains
no x68000 keyboard code yet. All it does so far is handle the BLE
pairing and bonding, and even that needs a bit of optimisation yet

**NB 2:** Initial version will likely also only support a keyboard but a mouse at the same time should be quite possible.

License TBD
